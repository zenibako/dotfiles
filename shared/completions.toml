# Shared completion definitions for zsh and nushell
# This file is the single source of truth for CLI tool completions.
#
# Usage:
#   - zsh: parsed with a helper function, outputs to ~/.zsh/completion/_<tool>
#   - nushell: parsed natively, outputs to ~/.cache/completions/<tool>.nu
#
# Each tool has:
#   - zsh: command to generate zsh completions (piped to a file or sourced)
#   - nu: command to generate nushell completions (piped to a cache file)
#
# Empty string means:
#   - Handled by carapace bridge (nushell)
#   - Handled by oh-my-zsh plugin (zsh)
#   - Manual completions already exist
#   - Tool doesn't support that shell
#
# Tools are automatically skipped if not found in PATH.
